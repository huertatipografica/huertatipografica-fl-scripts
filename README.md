# ABOUT

These are Python scripts for use with the [Fontlab Studio 5 font editor](http://old.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/) made by Juan Pablo del Peral and Andrés Torresi for Huerta Tipográfica (http://www.huertatipografica.com / @huertatipo)
Before running any script please take a look to the code and make a backup of your files. Most of the macros are not 'ready-to-use' and need some tweaking to adapt them to specific situations.

# INSTALLATION
Save under Fontlab Studio 5 installation macros folder.
